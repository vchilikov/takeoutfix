# Cloud Upload Guides

Use these guides after TakeoutFix finishes with `Status: SUCCESS`.

## Choose Your Target Storage

- Yandex Disk (English): [yandex-disk.en.md](yandex-disk.en.md)
- Yandex Disk (Russian): [yandex-disk.ru.md](yandex-disk.ru.md)
- Dropbox: [dropbox.md](dropbox.md)
- OneDrive: [onedrive.md](onedrive.md)
- iCloud Photos: [icloud-photos.md](icloud-photos.md)

## Common Migration Rules

1. Upload processed files from `takeoutfix-extracted/Takeout`, not original ZIP archives.
2. Keep the folder structure unchanged during upload.
3. Do not delete your local processed copy until cloud verification is complete.
4. Verify date order and location metadata on several random files before cleanup.
5. Keep `takeoutfix-extracted` as a local backup for at least one full sync cycle.
